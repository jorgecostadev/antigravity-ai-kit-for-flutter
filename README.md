# Antigravity AI Agent Kit

The `.agent` directory contains the configuration, skills, workflows, and rules that power the AI agent's capabilities within this project.

## Main Goal

The primary goal of this directory is to provide a structured context and a set of tools for the AI agent to effectively assist in the development process. It serves as the "Brain" or "Knowledge Base" of the agent for this specific project.

It includes:
- **Agents**: Specialized agent configurations.
- **Rules**: Project-specific rules and guidelines (e.g., Architecture, Code Style).
- **Skills**: Specialized knowledge bases and capabilities (e.g., Flutter Architecture, State Management).
- **Workflows**: Defined processes for common tasks (e.g., creating a new entity, adding a feature).

## Technology Stack

**IMPORTANT**: All files and configurations within this directory are specifically generated and optimized to be used with **Dart** and **Flutter** projects.

- **Language**: Dart
- **Framework**: Flutter

The skills and rules enforce best practices, architectural patterns, and coding standards specific to the Dart and Flutter ecosystem.
